Once upon a time, across the sea there lived a monster. This monster was huge, and had a brother. I am thinkin what other things I can put in here to test this program out.
This isn't usually how I would type. I will have to use words here to just test the program. I will then push this repository to Github, because version control is great.
This is a difficult thing to do, but I don't mind the challenge. I can't wait to say I did this and show people like my mother, father or sisters this program.
